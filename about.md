I am currently the Metadata Librarian at the University of Colorado Boulder where I have worked since 2018. Prior to that I have worked as the Metadata Librarian at the University of Arizona and University of Kansas. I received
my M.S. in Library and Information Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

My interests include metadata, semiotics, critical theory, linked data, and dialectics.
