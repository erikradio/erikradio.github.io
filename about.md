I am the metadata librarian and associate professor at the University of Colorado Boulder Libraries where I have worked since 2018. I also lead the Metadata Production and Curation unit. Prior to that I have worked as the Metadata Librarian at the University of Arizona and University of Kansas. I received my M.S. in Library and Information Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

My interests include metadata, document theory, and dialectics.
