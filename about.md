I am an associate professor at the university of colorado coulder libraries where I have worked as the metadata librarian since 2018. I also lead the metadata production and curation unit. Prior to that I have worked as the metadata librarian at the university of arizona and university of kansas. I received my m.s. in library and information science from the university of illinois at urbana-champaign.

My interests include metadata, document theory, and dialectics.
